# FluidSim: A Playground for Fluid Simulation

## Currently Support:

- 3D PIC/FLIP Free Surface Simulation, using finite volume method and modified incomplete Cholesky preconditioned conjugate gradient
  method to solve the pressure Poisson equation.
- GPU smoke simulation, using MGPCG iteration to solve the pressure Poisson equation.
