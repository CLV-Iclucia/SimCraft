# SimCraft

SimCraft is my personal physics simulation playground.
It will become a collection of algorithms of physics simulation in computer graphics.

There is nothing special here yet, so I suggest that you should come back months later.

## Dependencies

Up till now I have used the following external libraries:

- glad for OpenGL loading

- glfw for window management

- glm for basic 3D math

- Eigen for sparse linear algebra

- TBB for CPU parallel execution
