# SimCraft

SimCraft is my personal physics based simulation playground, where I implement and test various simulation stuffs

## Now it includes

The following projects have usable apps and libraries
- Hybrid style fluid simulation 
- FEM soft body simulator using IPC (Incremental Potential Contact) method
- Deformation energy computing tools
- A suite of tiny OpenGL GUI tools

More features are under construction, and I will update this README when they are ready.

- Complete Support for CUDA fluid simulation
- More advanced and flexible FEM soft body simulator
