# SimCraft

SimCraft is my personal physics simulation playground.
It will become a collection of algorithms of physics simulation in computer graphics.

There is nothing special here yet, so I suggest that you should come back months later.

## dependencies

Up till now I have used imgui for GUI, glfw for window management, glm and Eigen for math.
